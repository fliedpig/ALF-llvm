Tests known to fail:

* alloca2

Blame: SWEET
Reason: dyn_alloc not supported by SWEET
[sweet] Unknown expression nodetype in CAlfTreeTraversor::Traverse(const AExpr* expr)!

* bug_top_cmp2

Blame: SWEET
Reason: Bug #269
[sweet] Execution of switch statement at { 54, 8 } did not result in any successor states.

* indirect3, indirect4

Blame: SWEET
Reason: Indirect calls of the form (offset = [0..2] * 4; *(fptab+offs)()) are not supported by
        SWEET. I'm not sure whether this is only due to missing congruence closure support,
        or other issues.
[sweet] Cannot extract (symbol, offset) pairs from value

* indirect5

Blame: llvm2alf
Reason: Indirect branches (a.k.a. goto label offset) are not supported by llvm2alf yet
[llvm2alf] Error: indirect branch instruction not yet supported

* pointer_undef1

Blame: SWEET
Reason: same as bug_top_cmp2
[sweet] Execution of switch statement at { 93, 8 } did not result in any successor states
        (i.e., no branch was followed).

* nondet2

Blame: General
Reason: Restrictions do not take aliasing into account.
   For example, after %z = load %x, assert (%x < 3),
   we should have (%x < 3) (because %x = %z)
[sweet] Timeout

* sample

Blame: Too difficult
[sweet] Timeout
