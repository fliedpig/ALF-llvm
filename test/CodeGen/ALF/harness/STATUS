Tests known to fail:

* alloca2

Blame: SWEET
Reason: dyn_alloc not supported by SWEET
[sweet] Unknown expression nodetype in CAlfTreeTraversor::Traverse(const AExpr* expr)!

* bool

Blame: llvm2alf
Reason: ALF translator does not handle struct type arguments correctly
[sweet] Call to function: getbit with the wrong size of argument 1

* bug_top_cmp2

Blame: SWEET
Reason: Bug #269
[sweet] Execution of switch statement at { 54, 8 } did not result in any successor states.

* indirect3, indirect4

Blame: SWEET?
Reason: Indirect calls of the form (offset = [0..2] * 4; *(fptab+offs)()) do not work in SWEET.
        I'm not sure whether this is only due to missing congruence closure support, or other
        issues.
[sweet] Cannot extract (symbol, offset) pairs from value

* indirect5

Blame: llvm2alf
Reason: Indirect branches (a.k.a. goto label offset) are not supported by llvm2alf yet
[llvm2alf] Error: indirect branch instruction not yet supported

* nondet2

[sweet] Timeout

* pointer_undef1

Blame: SWEET
Reason: same as bug_top_cmp2
[sweet] Execution of switch statement at { 93, 8 } did not result in any successor states
        (i.e., no branch was followed).

* sample

[sweet] Timeout
